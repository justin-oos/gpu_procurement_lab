Executive Report: H100 GPU Procurement

**1. Executive Summary**
This report summarizes the findings of an immediate investigation to procure 500 NVIDIA H100 GPUs. The investigation involved inventory, legal, and logistics checks. We have located a total of 550 units, but only 250 are immediately available for purchase.

**2. Detailed Findings**
*   **Internal Inventory:** Our internal inventory search located 300 H100 GPUs. However, these units are currently under a "Quarantine" status (bin location 55).
*   **Legal Status:** A legal review of the quarantined units determined that they cannot be released. This is due to an exclusivity clause in our Master Supply Agreement with NVIDIA. The only exception to this clause is a "Force Majeure" event, which is not applicable at this time, or a 60-day delivery failure from NVIDIA.
*   **Logistics and Spot Market:** A search of the spot market revealed an additional 250 H100 GPUs. These are available for immediate purchase at a price of $32,000 per unit.

**3. Recommendations**
*   **Immediate Procurement:** We can immediately purchase the 250 H100 GPUs available on the spot market. This will partially fulfill our immediate need.
*   **Contingency Planning:** We need to initiate a dialog with NVIDIA to address the delivery schedule and the exclusivity clause in our contract. If NVIDIA cannot meet our needs within the 60-day window, we will be able to release the 300 quarantined units.
