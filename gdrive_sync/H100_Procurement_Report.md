# Executive Report: H100 GPU Procurement

## Summary

This report outlines the findings of the investigation to procure 500 H100 GPUs. We have identified a total of 550 units available through various channels.

## Findings

| Source | Quantity | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Internal Inventory** | 300 | Quarantined | Found in a 'hold' bin at location 55. Currently under legal review. |
| **Legal Validation** | (300) | Pending Validation | These units are on hold due to a potential breach of the exclusivity clause in our Master Supply Agreement. They can be released if we can provide evidence that NVIDIA delayed a confirmed delivery by more than 60 days. |
| **Spot Market** | 250 | Available | Sourced from the spot market at a price of $32,000 per unit. |

## Recommendations

1.  **Validate Quarantined Units:** Immediately provide the necessary documentation to the Legal team to validate and release the 300 quarantined H100 GPUs.
2.  **Spot Market Purchase:** Procure 200 of the 250 available units from the spot market to meet the immediate requirement of 500 units.
3.  **Future Actions:** Review the Master Supply Agreement to prevent future quarantine situations.

With the 300 quarantined units and 200 from the spot market, we can meet the 500 H100 GPU requirement.
