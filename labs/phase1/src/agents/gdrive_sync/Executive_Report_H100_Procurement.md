# Executive Report: H100 GPU Procurement

**Summary:**
We have identified a total of 550 H100 GPUs, exceeding our immediate requirement of 500 units.

**Details:**
- **Internal Inventory:** 300 units have been located in our internal inventory (bin '55'). These units are currently under a "Pending Supplier Verification" status. The legal department has confirmed that we can use these units if our primary supplier has delayed delivery by more than 60 days.
- **Spot Market:** 250 units are available for immediate purchase from the reseller "FastChips_Reseller_LLC" at a price of $32,000 per unit.

**Recommendations:**
1. Verify the delivery status with our primary supplier. If the delivery is delayed by more than 60 days, we can secure the 300 units from our internal inventory.
2. Proceed with the purchase of 250 units from FastChips_Reseller_LLC to meet the immediate demand.

This report summarizes the findings of the investigation.
